### Structural Study of Plant Receptor Kinases

### Jijie Chai - Max Planck Institute for Breeding Research; University of Cologne



Plant receptor kinases \(RKs\) are a large family of single transmembrane proteins that play important roles in diverse biological processes including development, growth and immunity. RKs are characterized with diversified extracellular domains \(ECDs\) and conserved intracellular kinase domains. Recognition of their cognate ligands by ECDs of RKs initiates activation of RKs. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process remained poorly defined. We recently solved the crystal structures of the ECDs derived from several RKs in complex with their respective ligands. These structures define the molecular mechanisms by which these RKs recognize their specific ligands. More importantly, a general mechanism underlying ligand-induced activation of RKs can be formulated. In the current talk, I will briefly review what we have done on structural study of RKs and present two examples of how RK activation and ligand recognition mechanisms were used for the matching of receptor-ligand pairs. 

### About Jijie Chai

> ### Jijie Chai was born on April 16, 1966 in Liaoning province, China. He received his bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Dalian Light Industry College, master's degree in applied chemistry from the Research Institute of Petroleum Processing \(Beijing\) and Ph.D. in analytical chemistry from the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. 
>
> ### From 1999 to 2004, he worked as postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, where he started his research in structural biology. In July 2004, he joined the National Institute of Biological Sciences as an independent investigator, where he established his own research programs, structural study of plant receptor kinases  and NOD-like receptors. After working there for six and half years, he moved to Tsinghua University and continued his research as a full professor. 
>
> ### Early last year, he was awarded with the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship, and he moved to Cologne late March of 2017. Jijie has published a number of papers on RLKs and NLRs, advancing our understanding the mechanisms of RLK activation and NLR inhibition and activation. Jijie is happily married and the father of a daughter. He is currently living in Cologne.

# Welcome to The Sainsbury Laboratory Summer School 2017

The last 20 years have provided a sophisticated understanding of how plants recognise relatively conserved microbial patterns to activate defence. In recent years DNA sequencing allowed genomes and transcriptomes of eukaryotic rusts and mildew pathogens to be studied and high-throughput imaging permit the study and visualisation of intracellular interactions during pathogenesis and defence. 

We will present many aspects of plant-microbe interactions including genomic, cellular and molecular processes to translational activities. 

The TSL Summer School will focus on dynamic and interactive practical sessions will naturally promote strong interactions between speakers and participants.

We will cover a wide range of topics, including:



* Pathogenomics
* Effectors
* Surface Immunity
* Bioinformatics
* Resistance Proteins
* Cellular Defence
* Proteomics
* Wheat Genomics
* Translation to the field
